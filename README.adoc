= Linux notes

These are some of my personal notes that help me when installing Linux. They're great for me to:

- Copy commands syntax
- Copy lists of packages to paste into the package manager
- Remember to do all the stuff I like to do
- Keep track of various config files and tuning parameters

Originally, they made little sense to anyone but me. Currently, I'm trying to rewrite them to be more accessible and structured. Not guaranteed to be comprehensible at all times.
